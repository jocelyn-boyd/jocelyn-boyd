# About me
I am an iOS Developer trained at [Pursuit](https://www.pursuit.org/), an intensive 10-month fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate.

My programming philosophy comes from my passion for creating positive user experiences and problem-solving. I am a career-changer with a background in ESOL (English Speaking Other Languages) and Japanese studies.

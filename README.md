# About me
I am an iOS Developer trained at Pursuit, an intensive 10-month fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate. I had the experience of collaboration and mentorship with product managers, engineers, and other professionals in the industry to bring the features in my capstone and personal project applications to life. My programming philosophy comes from my passion for creating positive user experiences and problem-solving. I am a career-changer with a teaching background in adult ESL education, curriculum development, and Japanese studies. I want to grow my technical skills by creating a purposeful impact and establishing close professional relationships with colleagues.

👩🏾‍💻   I'm currently working on ...
* A personal project called [Recipe Box](https://github.com/jocelyn-boyd/recipe-box-swiftui/blob/main/README.md) in SwiftUI, a mobile search and management application for online recipes. **Update: Recipe Box v.1.0.0 is ready for TestFlight!** 🎉

* Building out [code-buddies](https://github.com/jocelyn-boyd/code-buddies), an iOS development learning resource for self-driven learners like myself. 

🌱   I'm currently learning ...
* SwiftUI framework
* how to strengthen my algorithmic thinking skills.

🏢   Seeking a junior iOS Software Engineer role.

🙂   Fun Fact: I lived abroad in Japan for several years. I am really into Japanese history and love exploring the castles, temples and shrines. I have made 45 recorded visits to temples and shrines around the country.

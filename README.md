# About me
I am an iOS Developer. My programming philosophy comes from my passion for creating positive user experiences and problem-solving. I am a career-changer with a teaching background in adult ESL education, curriculum development, and Japanese studies. I want to grow my technical skills by creating a purposeful impact and establishing close professional relationships with colleagues.

👩🏾‍💻   I'm currently working on ...
* A personal project called [Recipe Box](https://github.com/jocelyn-boyd/recipe-box-swiftui/blob/main/README.md) in SwiftUI, a mobile search and management application for online recipes.

* Building out [code-buddies](https://github.com/jocelyn-boyd/code-buddies), an iOS development learning resource for self-driven learners like myself. 

🌱   I'm currently learning ...
* how to strengthen my algorithmic thinking skills

🙂   Fun Fact: I lived abroad in Japan for several years. I am really into Japanese history and love exploring the castles, temples and shrines. I have made 45 recorded visits to temples and shrines around the country.

# About me
My programming philosophy comes from my passion for problem-solving and creating positive user experiences.

👩🏾‍💻   I'm currently working on ...
* A SwiftUI side project, [Recipe Box] 2.0 (https://apps.apple.com/app/id1580841695), a mobile search and management application for online recipes. Version 1.0 is in the App Store now!

🌱   I'm currently learning ...

* How to strengthen my algorithmic thinking skills. Check out my [DSA cheat sheet](https://github.com/jocelyn-boyd/code-buddies/blob/main/dsa.md)! It's a work in progress.

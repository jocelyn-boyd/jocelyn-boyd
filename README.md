# About me
I am a career-changer with a background in adult ESL education. My programming philosophy comes from my passion for problem-solving and creating positive user experiences.

👩🏾‍💻   I'm currently working on ...
* A personal project called [Recipe Box](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1580841695) in SwiftUI, a mobile search and management application for online recipes. Version 1.0 is in the App Store now!

* Building out [code-buddies](https://github.com/jocelyn-boyd/code-buddies), an software engineering learning resource for self-driven learners like myself

🌱   I'm currently learning ...
* Full-Stack Web Development @ Flatiron School -- Check out my [website profile](https://jocelyn-boyd.netlify.app)!

* How to strengthen my algorithmic thinking skills. Check out my DSA cheat sheet! It's a work in progress. 

🙂   Fun Fact: I lived abroad in Japan for several years. I am really into Japanese history and love exploring the castles, temples and shrines. I have made 45 recorded visits to temples and shrines around the country.
